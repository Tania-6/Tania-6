I’m a Computer Programming & Analysis student at St. Lawrence College and an aspiring full-stack web developer. I enjoy building web applications and bringing creative ideas to life.

I’m most drawn to the design side of web development, but I also enjoy working on the backend and understanding how everything connects. I’m organized, efficient, and detail-oriented.

I’m a quick learner and I’m not afraid to ask questions. I believe that curiosity and clear communication lead to the best results!
